This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game developed using Flutter. It's a classic two-player game where the goal is to get three of your symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal.

Features
Two-player mode: Play against a friend locally.
Interactive UI: Enjoy a user-friendly interface for a smooth gaming experience.
Win Detection: The game will automatically detect when a player wins and declare the winner.
Reset Option: You can reset the game board at any time to start a new match.
How to Play
Launch the app on your Flutter-supported device.
You'll see a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
Player 1 ('X') goes first.
To make a move, tap on an empty cell on the grid.
The game alternates between players, and the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
If there's no winner and the board is filled, the game ends in a draw.
You can reset the game at any time to start a new match.
